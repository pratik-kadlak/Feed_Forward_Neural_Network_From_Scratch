# Neural Network from Scratch for Fashion MNIST

This project implements a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of fashion items, such as shirts, pants, shoes, and more. The goal of this project is to build a neural network model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Features

- Supports customizable hyperparameters for training the neural network.
- Allows selection of different activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, and more.
- Provides options for configuring the number of layers, hidden units, batch size, and learning rate.
